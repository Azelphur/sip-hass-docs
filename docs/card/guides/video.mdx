title: Video Between Cards
---

When you enable video, the card sends your webcam feed and receives a video feed. This allows for low-latency live video between the cards or SIP devices.

## Requirements

For this guide you will need the following:

- Working PBX
- Card installed and configured
- Webcam that works in your browser
- Browser that supports the received codec

## How to use

First, enable make sure <b>video support</b> is enabled in your PBX.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="pbx">
  <TabItem value="addon" label="Add-on" default>
    For the add-on, simply turn on <code>video_support</code> and restart.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="custom" label="Custom PBX">
    If you have a custom PBX, add <code>video_support=on</code> to your <b>SIP</b> endpoint. If you have something like <b>FreePBX</b>, turn on the <b>video support</b> option.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then turn on the `video` option in the card.

And that's it. If everything is correct, you should now eachother the webcam when you call another card.
